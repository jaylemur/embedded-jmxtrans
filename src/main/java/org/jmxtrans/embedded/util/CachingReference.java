/**
 * Maintains a cached version of the {@code Object} that it holds and handle the renewal of this object upon expiration.
 *
 * Greatly inspired by the {@code CachedData} sample provided in the javadoc
 * of {@link ReentrantReadWriteLock}.
 *
 * {@code Object} is created implementing the {@link #newObject()} method.
 *
 * Sample to get an {@code InetAddress} refreshed against a DNS every 10 seconds:
 * <pre><code>
 * CachingReference myRemoteServerAddress = new CachingReference&lt;InetAddress&gt;(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS) {
 *     protected InetAddress newObject() {
 *         try {
 *             return InetAddress.getByName(myRemoteServerHostname);
 *         } catch () {
 *             throw new RuntimeException("Exception resolving '" + myRemoteServerHostname + "'", e);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
